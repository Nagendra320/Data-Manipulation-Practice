# Data Science Exploration with Python

Welcome to my repository where I explore data analysis and visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. This repository is a collection of my practice sessions, where I work through various data manipulation tasks to refine my skills and deepen my understanding of data science concepts.

## Technologies Used

In this repository, I utilize the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical operations on large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

## Repository Structure

Each file in this repository contains the creation of two data frames, followed by a set of questions that address different aspects of data manipulation and analysis, and the corresponding solutions. These exercises are designed to demonstrate practical applications of Pandas and NumPy in solving real-world data problems.

## About Me

I'm a transitioning engineer, currently enhancing my data science skills at Scaler Academy. I focus on machine learning, data visualization with Tableau, and advanced statistical analysis using SQL and Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn). I am passionate about leveraging data to derive insights that drive strategic business decisions and innovation.
